[Click here](https://github.com/nk-world/StatisticsCalc/releases/) to go to releases and download it.

# Using
  1. Open the application
  2. Choose the type of data
  3. For individual series: 
Input the data separated by commas, the result will be displayed as the data is typed. Each data separated by comma must be a positive or negative number with or without decimal parts. Any invalid input including the numbers attached with invalid characters will be ignored.
  4. For discrete series:
There is a separate column for entering data and frequency. The data can be a positive or negative number with or without decimal parts whereas the frequency must be a positive integer. Any invalid input will show an error message.
5. For continuous series:
There is a separate column for entering the class interval and frequency. The class interval must be in the format "a-b" where a>b and it must not overlap any other existing class intervals. The frequency must be a positive integer.
6. The `Refresh` button can be pressed in case the data does not update automatically even when it should.
